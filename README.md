## Features
- __Enhanced API:__ Stori provides a rich API with first-class support for registry administration tasks.

## Philosophy
The Stori project is meant to be a reference implementation of, and serve as a testbed for improvements to, the OCI Distribution Specification.
Stori also solves another problem in the current state on container affairs, the need for an extendable, lightweight, and enterprise-level image registry.
